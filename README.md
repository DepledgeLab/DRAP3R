# DRAP3R
Direct Read and Analysis of RNA Polymerase III derived RNAs

## Welcome to the DRAP3R repository

DRAP3R is a custom nanopore direct RNA sequencing method and analysis framework that enables the specific and sensitive capture of nascent Pol III-derived RNAs (and a small subset of Pol II-derived ncRNAs) 

This repository contains all data files and code needed to reproduce the figures and analyses shown in our manuscript, which is currently available on bioRxiv.
