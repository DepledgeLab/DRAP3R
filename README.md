## Welcome to the DRAP3R repository

DRAP3R (Direct Read and Analysis of RNA Polymerase III derived RNAs) is a custom nanopore direct RNA sequencing method and analysis framework that enables the specific and sensitive capture of nascent Pol III-derived RNAs (and a small subset of Pol II-derived ncRNAs) 

This repository contains all data files and code needed to reproduce the figures and analyses shown in our manuscript, which is currently available on bioRxiv.


### Folder descriptions

Code:


<em> note that data files required for some scripts in Fig 1 and Fig S1 directories are hosted at [FigShare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28554524.v1 )</em>
<br>

Databases: 
- GTF file for Pol III transcribed RNAs
- mature tRNA sequences in multi-fasta format (includes 5' and 3' splint adapters)
